Prodecural Generation Brainstorming

Goals:
	* Random level generation

	* Create a mapping system that allows for switching between cave and open air


	* Cave system will be randomly generated with obstacles (stalagmites/stalactites).

	* Randomness of AA guns on the ground and rockets/planes that are shot at the player

Strategies for procedural generation:

	* Noise functions:
		* Perlin noise

Classes:
	AA Guns:
		* Detect player but bullets do not track
		* Aiming to intercept the player in flight
		*Randomness of shooting delay/ bullet speed
